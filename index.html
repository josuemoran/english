        <ul>
            <li>Definition
                <ul>
                    <li>“Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or NPD, is one of a cluster of Personality Disorders that includes border-line personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder, in which people often display
                        a character of self-obsession, egotistic, and hubris</li>

            </li>
            <li> Possible causes: Unknown </Li>
            <ul>
                It is not known what causes NPD because the cause can likely be complex, but it can be linked to:

                <li>Mismatches in parent-child relationships with either excessive pampering or excessive criticism</li>
                <li>Genetics or psychobiology — the connection between the brain and behavior and thinking</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Having an exaggerated sense of self-importance</li>

                    <li>Exaggerating your achievements and talents</li>
                    <li>Being preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate
                    </li>
                    <li>Believing that you are superior and can only be understood by or associate with equally special people
                    </li>
                    <li>Taking advantage of others to get what you want
                    </li>
                    <li>Having an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others
